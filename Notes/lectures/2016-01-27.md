# Semaphores, Processes, and Threads
## Housekeeping
* Extension to P1 - due Feb 3

## Program 2 - Shell
* Major tasks
  * Command line parsing
    * ush.tar.gz
  * Command execution
    * `fork(2)`
    * exec family: `execvp(2)` might be the best
  * I/O redirection
    * `open(2)`, `close(2)` (not fopen, fclose)
    * `dup(2)`, `dup2(3c)`
    * `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`
  * Environment variable
    * `putenv(3c)`, `getenv(3c)`
  * Signal handling
    * `signal(5)`
    * `signal(3c)`
    * `getpid(2)`, `getpgrp(2)`, `getppid(2)`, `getpgid(2)`
    * `setpgid(2)`, `setpgrp(2)`
* A shell is similar to a series of pipes where every line is a sequence of pipes
* This program can use the boiler plate code 
  * The series of pipes can represented as a linked list
* Due FEB 27

## Lecture

#### Semaphores
* Consider it as a measurement of the difference between number of signals and waits
* Semaphores are more than locks. You can wait for the lock, but semaphores are more than this
* signal is similar to release the lock while wait is similar to a request to the lock
* Conceptual code: 

```c
wait(S) {
    while(S <= 0) {
        S--;
    }
}   
signal(S) {
    S++;
}
```

* You typically do not want to wait with a busy loop as such a loop takes resources so instead queue up
* What happens when the process exits before release? That is the issue. Semaphores are not locks
* The signal and wait are independent. They only care about the state of the semaphores
* Again, they are just a measurement of state
* Pseudo code:

```c
wait(sem) {
    value--;
    if(value < 0) {
        queue(this.process, this.sem.waitq);
        block(this);
    }
}
signal(sem) {
    value++;
    if(value <= 0) { //If the sem value transitioned from negative to 0
        PID = dequeue(this.sem.waitq);
        wakeup(PID);
    }
}
```

#### Threads vs processes 
* Processes are self-contained including file descriptors and memory
* Threads have a stack and context, but they all share memory
* So does this mean the differentiation between a process and thread is who manages them? IE Kernel vs Userspace?
* All threads of the same process will have only kernel thread
* Userspace threads are faster and more flexible
* Kernel threads allow for parallelism and offloading (allow some threads to run while others block (for ex on IO))
* Process can be thought of as a *resource principal* 
  * Resource principal, address space manager, protection domain (permissions), and threads are the responsibilities of a process
* Historically we had only processes but now we can split it up into multiple threads
  * Allows protection domains to be contextually specific and sharing of address space
* **Process image** The physical representation of processes in OS including the process control structure
* Includes process contorl, ID, control info (state for ex), execution context
  * **Execution Context** similar to all the stuff swapped out with `swapcontext()`
    * Stack, RIP, registers, etc
