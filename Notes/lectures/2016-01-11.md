Lecture 002: 2016 - 01 - 11
===========================

Review
------
* OS is either a policeman or facilitator 
* OS abstracts the system 

Lecture 
-------
- **Abstraction** 
    - To disassociate from any specific instance to hide detail and complexity
    - Files do not actually exist, but files abstract the bits they represent
    - Example: 
        - Machine instructions (Byte code) (example: `0xffff837361833910`)
        - Assembly (example: `mov %rdi,%rax`
        - Programming language (example: `for i in range(0, 10) ...`)
    - Dangers
        - Overhead
        - Implicit policy so less flexibility
            - LRU cache, which is not the best cache for all instances
        - Abstraction inversions
            - Bit manipulation in java
- **Tradeoff** 
    - A lot of CS comes from math and engineering. The math side says "This is the best solution" while the engineering side says "This is the best solution based on the context"
- OS view is to create an abstract mahine
- The CPU provides only an ISA, and they never provide IO. This is done via devices. 
- The os abstracts this by creating a file to the allow reads and writes to the device. 
- **Concrete machine**
    - The physical hardware, ISA, and devices
    - CPU, interrupts (IRQ), Memory Management Unit (MMU), Persistent Storage, Cache, TLB (cache for VM to PM), Supervisor mode (ring 0), Trap, NIC
- **Abstract Machine**
- History
    - Monitor: thing that watched for Input
    - Needed protection due to being vulnerable to accidental/deliberate I/O
    - Didn't handle fatal mistakes like divide by 0 or looping without IO
- Traps
    - Can save PC, store exception code, transfer control, read in privledged mode, use system IO
